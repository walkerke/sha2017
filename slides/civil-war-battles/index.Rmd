### Web pages: client/server architecture

* **Web server** hosts and serves sites and data to be consumed by **web clients** (e.g. your browser)

## Tiled mapping

* To speed browsing, web maps often display map images as "tiles"
* Tiles are defined by their **zoom level** and **coordinates**
* Common coordinate system: __Web Mercator__

## CARTO

* Spatial database in the cloud
* 'Freemium' service; free to get started, more storage costs more money
* Powerful interface for running queries, visualizing your data; dashboard capabilities
* Link: http://www.carto.com

## What makes a good web map?

* Brian Timoney: maps should be __fast__, __intuitive__, __informative__, and __fast__!
* This can be accomplished through __generalization__ and __minimalism__

---

## Web map design

* Principles of web map design: 
 * Generalization
 * Scalability
 * Minimalism

---

## Generalization

* Important to consider purpose of your map when selecting resolution of your data

---

## Generalization

* At small scales, lots of detail can be unnecessary and computationally burdensome 
* Large feature services can be very slow in web maps
* When building applications, ask yourself: how much detail do I need?

* In ArcGIS: look for the "Generalization" toolset in the "Cartography" toolbox

---

## Scalability

Example: [NPR Census Map](http://www.npr.org/censusmap)

---

### Minimalism (when appropriate)
