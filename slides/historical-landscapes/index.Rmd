## Historical imagery

---

## Raster data

* Grid of cells that form a continuous surface
* Each grid cell contains a value that represents some real-world phenomena (e.g. elevation, land use)

---

### **Quantitative** and **qualitative** rasters

---

### Raster data resolution

* **Cell dimension**: the size of each grid cell (e.g. 30 meters by 30 meters)
* **Resolution**: the relative size of the grid cell

### Types of raster data

* ArcGIS and other GIS packages can handle a variety of raster formats, including:
  + Image files (JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, etc.)
  + Geo-enhanced image files (GeoTIFF, GeoJPEG)
  + ESRI GRID, ESRI ASCII GRID
  + Remotely sensed imagery (e.g. ERDAS Imagine .img files)
  + Many more.

### 3D coordinate systems

* _Z-coordinates_: vertical measurements (elevation), or measurement of magnitude

---

### Vertical datums

* Reference for measuring heights/elevation
* Common vertical datums:
  * Mean sea level
  * The geoid (orthometric heights)

### Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

* Raster representation of a terrain's (commonly the Earth's) surface

---

## How DEMs are produced

* Original elevation measurements taken by field surveying
* Additional information supplied by:
 + Analysis of remotely sensed imagery / photogrammetry
 + Laser technology (Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR)
* [Data: USGS 3D Elevation Program](https://nationalmap.gov/3DEP/)

---

## DEMs in ArcMap

---

## Surface (terrain) analysis

* Used to model the topographic characteristics of a given landscape
* Applications:
  + Shaded relief mapping
  + Construction and transportation planning
  + Hydrologic modeling (flood zones, river flow, watershed boundary delineation)

---
 
## Slope

* Definition: how elevation changes with horizontal position (rise over run!)
* In a GIS, slope is often measured in degrees

---

## How slope is calculated

---

## Aspect

* The steepest downhill direction at a given point; can be thought of as the __direction__ of the slope

<img src=img/aspect.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Hillshading

* Representation of three-dimensional characteristics of a two-dimensional surface
* Used to produce shaded relief maps

<img src=img/hillshade.jpg style="width: 600px">

---

## Surface analysis in ArcMap

---

## Contours

* Lines that connect cells of equal value in a raster (e.g. isolines)
* Applications: elevation, temperature, pollution, etc.

---

## Viewshed analysis

* __Viewshed__: the cells in a raster that can be viewed from a given point(s)
* __Lines of sight__ calculated for points based on a DEM

---

## 3D GIS concepts

* **Extrusion**: vertical stretching of a 2D shape for display in 3D, based on some attribute or value

* **Base heights**: how elevation/height values are defined within a three-dimensional GIS view

* **Drape**: display of a layer in three dimensions given the defined base heights
